## Work Today:
Today I worked on more effectively implementing hex board creation in the engine via construction.
This mostly entailed implementing code previously run in `BeginPlay()` to `OnConstruction()`.
While there are still some quirks to work out, most notably hex board deletion, it more or less works.

Along with that, I was able to test some hex-variation abilities by simply offsetting each hex on a sine wave:

With this, we were able to test out performance (which works well after setting the hexes' mobility to static) 
and the feasibility of first person combat within the hex board. 

The next steps are to completely fix construction (I can probably do this by parenting all hexes to an empty actor and then deleting that),
and to create a proper framework for biome-specific generation.
For biome generation, my plan is to create a system that allows me to pass the hex grid into a generic `Generator` class
that will create offsets and change/generate detail meshes.
