## Work this Week:
Unfortunately, there were quite a few *other* things going on this week preventing me from getting much work done.
Most notable of these were the Warren Tech Middle School Tours, where I led groups of 8th graders around WT for a few days.
Outside of that, my work for this week centered around creating a save system for games.

My initial thought was to use Unreal's built in persistence function, `SaveGame`, however, it does not provide quite as
much control as I would like, particularly with creating multiple saves (to be clear, I'm not saying it isn't possible, just not ideal).
Instead, I'm using Unreal's built in JSON serializer, `FJsonObjectConverter`, which can convert `UStruct`s to JSON.

After figuring out how to store data, I then needed to figure out *what* to store.
Each game needs to be stored, and in that game both player data and metadata for the game needs to be stored.
As such, I came up with the following save structure:
```
SavedGame_123456
| WorldData.json 
└ Player_0
  | PlayerInfo.json
  | Character_0.json
  | Character_1.json
  └ Character_3.json
└ Player_1
  | PlayerInfo.json
  | Character_0.json
  | Character_1.json
  └ Character_3.json
└ Etc.
```

This save structure can be represented with three `UStruct`s, `FPlayerInfo`, `FSaveState`, and `FPlayerPackage`.
`FPlayerInfo` saves the player metadata, `FSaveState` (might want to rename this one) saves character information,
and `FPlayerPackage` is a `struct` containing instances of both previously mentioned `struct`s. 
`FPlayerPackage` allows for easy passing of all player information, without the need for seperated data structures.
Additionally, there is a `FWorldState` `struct`, which saves the general (non-player specific) data for the game.

At the moment, the save system can take in a `FWorldData` instance and a `TArray<FPlayerPackage>` and save a new game instance.
The next steps are to properly connect this to the character creation system (I'd rather not talk about why I haven't done that yet),
and to read the data of specific games.

And as a final note, before anyone (yes, you) haggles on me for either not using `GameSave` or not having each save be a single
save file, please note that both are ***unable*** store nested `struct`s, which the save structure clearly requires.
However, I do want to note that I could write my own parser to read back a single file, but I'd rather use the
structure of the file system instead.
