# Blog for September 6, 2023
## Work Today:
Today I created some proof of concepts for procedural generation.
This entailed generating a noise map which is then used for height and tile selection.
Below is the result:

Along with this, over the past couple of days I have ironed out some issues.
These include fixing deletion of old hexes in `OnGeneration()`, which is done by tagging all hexes and then getting all tagged hexes.
I also fixed the issue where the hex grid would lose its references to the hexes on play via the same method mentioned above.

The next steps are to prove the viability of my generation system in terms of replication. After that, I can begin on some real generation,
which I have quite a few ideas for, most notably low and high pass cutoffs for water and mountains respectively.

On another note, I was able to correctly configure realtime lighting, which is required for procedurally generated hexes,
as we cannot rebake lightmaps everytime a board is generated.
However, realtime shadows currently cause a massive performance hit (seemingly upwards of 50% longer frametimes), even when using the deffered renderer.
At the moment, it is clear to me that another approach will have to be used, 
and at the moment I can think of implementing a gradient on the hexes to give them more definition.
Ambient occlusion would also help a lot, however I'm not sure how to configure this with independent meshes.

I also hope to clean up the repository for this blog with a `.gitignore`, so hopefully that works.
