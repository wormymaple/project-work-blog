# Blog for August 29, 2023
## Work Today:
As I'm still learning Unreal, progress on anything is very slow.
To start of the day, I began using JetBrains Rider for my IDE, as I already have a license and it has top of the line integration with Unreal.

The goal for today was to establish a highlighting system for player movement on the hex grid.
My process for this was to create a "highlighting" blueprint which could be spawned on accessible tiles when the player picked up their pawn.
That blueprint could then be spawned on hex tiles within a certain radius of the player pawn. 
A prototype of this was fairly easy to implement, and seemed to work just fine.
However, when testing this system in VR, it became apparent that something was extremely broken, as highlights were not spawning correctly at all.
After about an hour of debugging, I realized that the coordinate system of the pawn changed when it was picked up.
To fixed this, I simply stopped referring to the pawn's local (relative) coordinates, and began referring to it's world (component) coordinates.

This line of code fixed the issue:
```c++
FVector pawnPos = pawnMesh->GetComponentLocation();
```

Other than that, I just set up this blog, and that was the day.
