## Work for This and Last Week:
So first off, ignore what I said last week about the save system.
It *is* actually possible to serialize nested structs, so it is possible to save games entirely in one file.
The only work I've completed this week for Heroes of Paligon was to implement this single-file reading and writing.

### The Game Jam
For all of last week, we were tasked to create a short game surrounding the theme of "Warren Tech's 50th Anniversary".
The entire class decided to work as one team (probably for worse), creating a WarioWare style arcade game with Godot.
I was in charge of the GitHub repo for the game as well as a few games.
Immediately, issues with people's skill levels became apparent, and not much work was completed by any sub-team during
the game jam, mostly because of communication issues, but I digress.

But on another note, my game, which dealt with the Precision Machining department at WT ended up pretty well.
It's pretty simple, the player simple has to trace out a line with a "waterjet", where they are then scored on their
accuracy.
Because computing score based on every drawn point is inefficient and yielded poor results, I had to find a way
to simplify the shape that the player drew.
To do this, I recursively considered the dot product between the directions to each point's neighboring points.
If the resulting dot was close to one, that point was eliminated, as it was considered to be on a line.
Points with lower dot products were considered to be corners, and kept in the new, simplified polygon.

Here's the entire function in GDScript:
```
func simplify_shape(in_points, n):
	var new_points = [in_points[0]]
	for i in range(1, len(in_points) - 1):
		var point = in_points[i]
		var d1 = point.direction_to(in_points[i - 1])
		var d2 = point.direction_to(in_points[i + 1])
		
		if abs(d1.dot(d2)) < simp_threshold: # not sure why abs() is needed, but the dot is always negative
			new_points.append(point)
			
	new_points.append(in_points[-1])
	if len(new_points) < 3:
		return in_points
	
	if (n > 0):
		return simplify_shape(new_points, n - 1)
	else:
		return new_points
```

The resulting polygon is then compared to the target polygon, and a pass/fail score is generated.

Other than that, I also wrote some of the code to handle the general game loop, but none of that is particularly interesting.
