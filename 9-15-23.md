## Work Today:
The rest of this week I have implemented player piece moving on the hexagon grid.
This initially seemed, pretty simple, and it didn't end up being to bad, however, I did spend several hours debugging how
the link lists generated for each hexagon did not seem to persist when running the game.
It seems that Unreal simply does keep variables that are not marked with `#EditAnywhere` persistent.
I could fix this simply by generating the linked lists in `BeginPlay()` instead of `OnConstruction()`.
This might seem like a cheap workaround, however, new boards will be generated during runtime anyway, where the lists
will have to be calculated nonetheless.

After figuring that out, getting the pawn to move was as simple as creating a couple of functions inside of the
`GameBoardManager` which would track the input from a player piece when it was picked up or dropped.
Then, the manager shows the possible moves when the player picks up the piece, and then moves the piece to the closest
hex when the pawn is dropped.
The result is thus:

The next steps beyond this are to implement some better icons for the hex highlighting and to show where the player will
drop their pawn.
Of course though, all of this then has to be tested in multiplayer to ensure replication works well.
